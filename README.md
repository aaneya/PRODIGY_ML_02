# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

**Internship Project – ProDigy Infotech**  
📂 Task 2 – AI / Machine Learning  
📅 June 2025  

---

## 📌 Project Objective

This project aims to segment retail store customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses better understand customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (KMeans clustering)

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Mall_Customers.csv**  
📥 Download Link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

**Features Used:**
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

## 📈 Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Import Libraries  
Basic setup with data analysis and ML libraries.

### ✅ Step 2: Load Dataset  
Loaded and explored the `Mall_Customers.csv` file.

### ✅ Step 3: Feature Selection  
Selected `Annual Income` and `Spending Score` for clustering.

### ✅ Step 4: Elbow Method  
Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (`k=5`).

### ✅ Step 5: Apply KMeans  
Performed clustering using `KMeans(n_clusters=5)`.

### ✅ Step 6: Visualization  
Plotted clusters in different colors and marked centroids using scatter plots.

## 📸 Visual Output

- Elbow Curve  
- Clustered Scatter Plot with centroids

---

## 📁 Output

- **`Customer_Segments.csv`** – Dataset with cluster labels added  
- **`Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with full code and results

---

## 💡 Insights

The K-Means model segmented customers into 5 meaningful groups based on income and spending patterns, which can be used for:
- Targeted marketing
- Loyalty programs
- Budget planning
- Customer lifetime value estimation
